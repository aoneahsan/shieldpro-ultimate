study these as deeply as possible

i want to create a extension which should include features of all these three

i want to name that "AdBlocker-All-In-One" you can suggest a better name as you see fit

i will use claude code to create the extension it self, and i want to keep all the features in it free, mainly i want users to create a account, and the more info user provides the more features they will get, mean by default without login or providing any info they will get basic ads blocking, or let's say 20% features

let's they create a account they will get next 20% features, once they provide all the info we ask them (it should be a page where we can put data that we want them to provide, in start the basic info, email/phone/name/age/gender/etc, they will get next 20% of the features so far they have total of 60% of total extension features

next they can referer our extension to 30 people and they will get next 20% of the features and lastly for now, they have to open the extension about page once a week and click a button just to stay tune with our extension, and that will give them the last 20% of the features making it fully 100% available to that user

we need to explain this all proper in document files in markdown format, just exaplin all the features we need to develop, get all the details from these 3 extensions i shared, and mention top coding standards, design principles, programming practices, etc in a separate file properly

i want to use react with tailwindcss and radix ui for extension frontend, and i want to use firebase as it's backend to store user data, auth and any other thing that user provides us through extension

again no need to suggest any extension folder structure etc, claude code can handle that all

we just need to properly explain in painfull detail what we want
