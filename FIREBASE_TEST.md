# Firebase Permission Debugging

## Current Security Rules Status

### Fixed Issues:
1. **Safe Fallbacks**: Added existence checks before reading documents
   - `getUserTier()` now returns default tier 1 if user document doesn't exist
   - `isAdmin()` checks if document exists before reading

2. **Anonymous User Support**: 
   - Allow any authenticated user (including anonymous) to create their profile
   - Simplified authentication checks for initial operations

3. **Settings Access**: 
   - Allow authenticated users to read/write their settings even if they don't exist yet

## Potential Issues to Check:

### 1. Check if Firebase is initialized properly
Look in the browser console for:
- Firebase initialization errors
- Authentication state changes
- Network errors

### 2. Check Chrome DevTools Network Tab
Filter by "firestore" to see:
- Which documents are being accessed
- The exact permission error response

### 3. Common Permission Error Causes:

**Case 1: Trying to read before authentication**
- Solution: Ensure anonymous sign-in completes before any Firestore reads

**Case 2: Document path mismatch**
- Solution: Verify the exact path being accessed matches security rules

**Case 3: Missing required fields**
- Solution: Ensure all required fields are present when creating documents

## Quick Debug Steps:

1. Open Chrome DevTools Console
2. Look for the exact error message
3. Check which collection/document is causing the error
4. Note if user is authenticated when error occurs

## Security Rules Summary:

```javascript
// Users can:
- Read their own profile (users/{theirId})
- Create their own profile if authenticated
- Update their own profile (with restrictions)
- Read global stats (public)
- Read config documents (public)
- Access tier-based features based on their level
```

## If Still Getting Errors:

The error might be coming from:
1. Background service worker trying to access Firestore before auth
2. Content script trying to access Firestore directly (not allowed)
3. Popup trying to read user profile before sign-in completes

## Next Steps:

1. Open the extension popup
2. Open DevTools (right-click popup â†’ Inspect)
3. Look at Console tab for specific error
4. Check Network tab for failed Firestore requests
5. Note the exact document path that's failing

Then we can create a more specific rule for that path.
